# Ijustplaymc.github.io
I honestly dont know what else to say, its my github.io repo
Currently, it hosts a copy of eaglercraft 1.5.2. I just want to see if this works. As I dont feel like writing any code, I just ripped a html file from eaglercraft [https://eaglercraft.com/p/community/] 
I may add more things
